# Data Ethics for Photo-Forensics Internship

## Dataset
- The dataset consists only of **personal photos from my iPhone**.
- A small subset of 30 photos was copied for analysis.
- All photos are **random pictures of nature**; no faces or identifiable people appear.

## Handling
- **Files were never modified**; original filenames and formats are preserved.
- Only Python scripts are used to read metadata (creation and modification timestamps).

## Privacy & Consent
- Since these are my personal photos of nature, **no privacy concerns arise**.
- No identifiable personal data of others is included.

## Ethics Considerations
- All handling follows **responsible data practices**:
  - Read-only analysis
  - Transparent, documented steps
  - Safe storage within the project folder
- Any later expansion to other photo sources (e.g., Windows Photos) will follow the same ethical standards.
